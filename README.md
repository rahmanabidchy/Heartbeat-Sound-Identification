# Heartbeat-Sound-Identification
My first Deep Learning project. 

The dataset is made up of heartbeat sounds that need to be categorized based on multiple defective kinds of sounds.

More information on the dataset can be found here: http://www.peterjbentley.com/heartchallenge/

Also a drive link where you can download the dataset in .zip and the necessart .csv files.
